# agbe
Another Gane Boy Emulator written in C/C++.
Work in progress.

# About
To realize this project, I follow a subject of the school 42 that I found interesting (see [subject.pdf](https://github.com/kleborgn/agbe/blob/main/subject.pdf)).
I don't study in this school, I found the subject on the internet.

This project does not have the ambition to be accurate or complete, it's just a way to learn more about emulation.
